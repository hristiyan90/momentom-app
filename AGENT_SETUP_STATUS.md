# Agent Setup Status for Claude Code

**Date:** October 29, 2025
**Current Tool:** Claude Code (Terminal-based)
**Previous Tool:** Cursor (IDE-based with M_PR agent)

---

## Current Situation

You're asking about **subagents** because you previously worked with a multi-agent setup in **Cursor** where different specialist agents (Sports Science, Product Architect, UX/UI, etc.) helped with different aspects of the project.

**The 85-workout library you shared was created by your Sports Science Specialist agent in Cursor.**

---

## Agent Ecosystem Overview

Based on your documentation (`/docs/process/MULTI_AGENT_WORKFLOW.MD` and `/docs/process/AGENT_STATUS.MD`), you have a well-defined multi-agent architecture:

### Planning Cluster
- **Ops Orchestrator** - Sprint planning, feature breakdown, coordination

### Specification Cluster
- **Product Architect (M_PA)** - Core specs, API design, policy compliance
- **Sports Science Specialist** - Training methodology, evidence-based requirements
- **UX/UI Designer** - Interface design, user flows
- **AI/ML Engineer** - Algorithm design, adaptive systems

### Implementation Cluster
- **Prompt Agent (M_PR)** - Cursor implementation coordinator
- **QA Agent** - Validation against specifications
- **DevOps Agent** - Deployment coordination

---

## What's Available in Claude Code

Claude Code has a **Task tool** that can launch specialized agents, but they work differently than your Cursor agents:

### Claude Code Built-In Agents:
1. **`general-purpose`** - Complex multi-step tasks, research, code search
2. **`Explore`** - Fast codebase exploration (glob, grep, read)
3. **`statusline-setup`** - Configure status line
4. **`output-style-setup`** - Configure output styling

**Key Difference:** These are task-oriented agents, not role-based specialists like your Cursor setup.

## What We've Been Using (This Session)

In this Claude Code session, I've been operating as a **generalist** and have used:

‚úÖ **Direct tool calls:**
- Read, Write, Edit for file operations
- Bash for running scripts and migrations
- Grep, Glob for code search
- TodoWrite for task management

‚úÖ **Task agent (once):**
- Used `general-purpose` agent to fix the corrupted workout JSON
- Result: Successfully repaired and validated 85-workout library

‚ùå **Specialist agents:**
- No Sports Science Specialist available
- No Product Architect agent available
- No UX/UI Designer agent available
- These would need to be custom-built for Claude Code

---

## Gap Analysis: What's Missing

### Your Cursor Setup Had:
1. **Sports Science Specialist** - Created the 85-workout library with evidence-based protocols
2. **Product Architect** - Designed database schemas, API contracts, RLS policies
3. **Ops Orchestrator** - Sprint planning and coordination
4. **M_PR (Prompt Agent)** - Cursor implementation coordinator
5. **QA Agent** - Validation against specifications
6. **DevOps Agent** - Deployment coordination

### Claude Code Currently Has:
1. **Me (Claude)** - Acting as generalist across all roles
2. **Built-in Task agents** - For specific technical tasks (code search, file operations)

### What We Should Set Up:
**Option A: Create Custom Agents for Claude Code**
- Define specialist agents as slash commands in `.claude/commands/`
- Each command loads specialist context/prompts
- You invoke with `/sports-science`, `/product-architect`, etc.

**Option B: Continue Multi-Tool Workflow**
- Use Claude Code for general implementation and coordination
- Use Cursor for specialist work (Sports Science, UX/UI design)
- Share outputs (like the workout library) between tools

**Option C: Use Task Agent Creatively**
- Use `general-purpose` agent with detailed specialist prompts
- Example: "Act as Sports Science Specialist to review these workout progressions..."

## Recommended Setup for This Project

Based on your current Sprint 1.5 work, I recommend **Option B + C hybrid**:

### Immediate (Current Sprint 1.5):
1. **Continue with Claude Code** for:
   - Database migrations and schema work
   - Backend API development
   - Testing and verification
   - General implementation tasks

2. **Use Cursor Sports Science Specialist** for:
   - Workout library expansion (16 more workouts to reach 101)
   - Training plan generation algorithm validation
   - Zone calculation and fitness threshold logic

3. **Use Task Agent in Claude Code** when needed:
   - Complex codebase analysis
   - Multi-file refactoring
   - Bug investigation across modules

### Future (Sprint 2+):
Consider setting up **custom slash commands** for specialists:

```bash
/.claude/commands/sports-science.md
/.claude/commands/product-architect.md
/.claude/commands/qa-review.md
```

Each command would load specialist context and expertise for that domain.

- ‚úÖ Can use Claude Code alone (database security)
- üü° May want Product Architect review for policy design

**Workout Library Completion (16 more workouts):**
- ‚ùå **Should use Sports Science Specialist** in Cursor
- Evidence-based design requires domain expertise
- Proper work:rest ratios and progression logic
- Safety and periodization validation

### For Sprint 2 (Plan Generation):

**Definitely need:**
- üî¥ **Sports Science Specialist** - Plan generation algorithm design
- üî¥ **AI/ML Engineer** - Adaptive logic and optimization
- üî¥ **Product Architect** - API contracts and data models

**Can use Claude Code for:**
- Implementation of approved algorithms
- Database queries and optimization
- API endpoint development
- Testing and validation

## Action Items

### Immediate:
1. ‚úÖ **Complete GAP-3** with current 85 workouts (sufficient for MVP)
2. ‚úÖ **Run migrations** on remote Supabase
3. ‚úÖ **Verify deployment** with provided SQL queries

### Short-term (This Week):
4. **Decide on agent workflow:**
   - Continue Claude Code + Cursor hybrid?
   - Set up custom slash commands for specialists?
   - Document when to use which tool?

5. **For workout expansion (optional):**
   - Use Cursor Sports Science Specialist to generate remaining 16 workouts
   - Follow `/docs/library/expansion_summary.md` specifications
   - Validate against evidence-based protocols

### Next Sprint:
6. **Before Sprint 2 kickoff:**
   - Engage Product Architect for plan generation spec
   - Engage Sports Science + AI/ML for algorithm design
   - Consolidate specs before implementation

## Summary

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ You have a well-designed multi-agent architecture (documented)
- ‚úÖ Specialist agents exist in Cursor (Sports Science confirmed)
- ‚úÖ Claude Code doesn't have those specialists built-in
- ‚úÖ I've been acting as generalist successfully for GAP-2 and GAP-3

**Going Forward:**
- Use Claude Code for implementation and technical tasks
- Engage Cursor specialists for domain expertise (Sports Science, UX/UI)
- Consider setting up custom Claude Code slash commands for specialist roles
- Document clear handoffs between tools

**Bottom Line:**
Your specialists exist and work well in Cursor. For this Claude Code session, I've been covering all roles successfully, but for complex domain work (workout design, plan generation algorithms), you should definitely use your Sports Science Specialist in Cursor as you did for the 85-workout library.

---

**Questions to Consider:**

1. Do you want to continue using Claude Code for implementation + Cursor for specialists?
2. Should we set up custom specialist slash commands in Claude Code?
3. For the remaining 16 workouts, would you like to generate them in Cursor with Sports Science Specialist?
4. How do you want to coordinate between Claude Code and Cursor going forward?

Let me know your preference and I'll adapt the workflow accordingly!
