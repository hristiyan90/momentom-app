## How the New System Works

### You No Longer Switch Tools

**Old Workflow:**
```
You â†’ Claude Web (get spec) â†’ Copy spec â†’ Cursor IDE (implement) â†’ Back and forth
```

**New Workflow:**
```
You â†’ Claude Code â†’ Launch agents â†’ Get deliverables â†’ Done
(Everything in one environment)
```

### Example: Implementing a Feature

**You:** "Implement onboarding persistence"

**Claude Code:**
1. Analyzes current state, dependencies, gaps
2. Proposes approach with agent assignments
3. Launches Product Architect (if needed for spec)
4. Launches Backend + Frontend Engineers (parallel)
5. Launches QA + Security for verification
6. Compiles evidence and creates PR
7. Returns complete implementation with tests

**You:** Review and approve (or request changes)

### Your Role

- **Strategic decisions** - Prioritize work, approve approaches, make product choices
- **Quality oversight** - Review PRs, validate designs, ensure vision alignment
- **Feedback** - Guide agents when output isn't optimal

**Not your role anymore:**
- Managing context between tools
- Coordinating agent handoffs
- Compiling evidence for PRs
- Remembering policy requirements

Claude Code handles coordination, agents handle specialization, you focus on direction.

## What's Preserved from Cursor Workflow

### Process Philosophy âœ…

**C0 (Planning) â†’ C1 (Implementation) â†’ C5 (Verification)**

Still the core workflow, just distributed across specialized agents:

- **C0:** Claude Code (Orchestrator) + Product Architect
- **C1:** Backend/Frontend/Database Engineers
- **C5:** QA/Security/Performance Engineers

### Quality Standards âœ…

- **ETag Policy:** Canonical JSON, SHA-256, 304 responses
- **Auth Mapping:** JWT verification, RLS enforcement, `auth.uid()` scoping
- **CI Gates:** OpenAPI diff, Newman tests, smoke tests (Sprint 3+)
- **Small Commits:** â‰¤1 hour changes, reversible, incremental testing
- **Evidence-Based:** cURL examples, test outputs, screenshots in every PR

### Documentation Discipline âœ…

- **STATUS.md** - Current sprint progress
- **AGENT_STATUS.md** - Agent coordination tracking
- **AUTO_LOG.md** - Decision log (ADRs, RFCs)
- **Comprehensive PRs** - Complete evidence, clear rollback plan

---

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Test the System (Recommended - 15 minutes)

Pick one small gap from the analysis and run it through the new workflow:

**Suggested:** Fix ETag format to match policy (GAP-11 - Low priority, 15min task)

```
You: "Fix the ETag format to use sha256:<hex> instead of base64url"

Claude Code:
[Analyzes lib/http/etag.ts]
[Launches Backend Engineer]
[Backend Engineer fixes hash encoding]
[Launches QA Engineer for verification]
[Returns: Updated code + tests]

You: Review and approve
```

**Purpose:** Prove the system works, build confidence, refine if needed

### 2. Tackle Sprint 1.5 Critical Gaps (Recommended Path)

Based on the gap analysis, critical priority order:

**Week 1: Foundation Fixes (4-5 days)**
1. Session Management auto-refresh (1 day) - GAP-2
2. Onboarding persistence (2-3 days) - GAP-1
3. RLS wellness_data + 3-account test (0.75 day) - GAP-6, GAP-7

**Week 2: UI & Data Integration (3-4 days)**
4. Cockpit real data integration (0.5-1 day) - GAP-4
5. Calendar life blockers & races backend (2 days) - GAP-5
6. Workout library seeding (0.5 day) - GAP-3

**Total: ~8-9 days to Sprint 1.5 complete**

### 3. OR Start Sprint 2 (If You Prefer)

If you want to move forward with plan generation despite gaps:

**Minimal Path to Sprint 2:**
1. Complete GAP-1 (Onboarding persistence) - 2-3 days
2. Complete GAP-2 (Session management) - 1 day
3. Defer UI wiring (GAP-4, GAP-5) to Sprint 2

Then Sprint 2 can start, but you won't be able to dogfood the Cockpit/Calendar UI.

---

## Your Decision Point

**Option A: Fix Foundation First (RECOMMENDED)**
- **Timeline:** ~2 weeks
- **Outcome:** Solid Sprint 1.5 completion, working UI you can use daily
- **Benefit:** Can dogfood your own app, better foundation for Sprint 2
- **Approach:** Use agents to tackle gaps systematically

**Option B: Minimal Path to Sprint 2**
- **Timeline:** ~1 week
- **Outcome:** Can start plan generation, but UI still shows mocks
- **Benefit:** Faster to Sprint 2 algorithm work
- **Trade-off:** Won't be able to fully test integrated experience

**Option C: Test System First, Then Decide**
- **Timeline:** 15 min test + decision
- **Outcome:** Confidence in multi-agent system before committing
- **Benefit:** See how agents work before large task
- **Approach:** Pick GAP-11 (ETag format fix), run through workflow

## How to Proceed Right Now

**Just say:**

1. **"Let's test the system with GAP-11"** (15 min confidence builder)
2. **"Let's start with GAP-2 (session management)"** (dive into Sprint 1.5)
3. **"Let's plan Sprint 2"** (if you want to skip ahead)
4. **"Show me MCP recommendations"** (if you want additional tool integrations)

I'm ready to coordinate whichever path you choose!

## Summary

ðŸŽ‰ **Claude Code multi-agent system is live and ready.**

You now have:

- 10 specialist agents (coordinated by me)
- Preserved quality standards (C0â†’C1â†’C5)
- Clear project analysis (14 gaps, prioritized)
- Three paths forward (fix foundation, minimal Sprint 2, or test first)

**The transition is complete. Let's build.** ðŸš€
