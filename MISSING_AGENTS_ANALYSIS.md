## Missing Agents - Gap Analysis

### üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY - Needed for Current Sprint

#### 1. UX/UI Designer
**Why missing:** Referenced 10+ times in Sprint 1.5 plan but not in CLAUDE.md roster!

**Sprint mentions:**
- Task 1.5-B: "Full-Stack Dev + **UX/UI**"
- Task 2-D: "**UX/UI** + Full-Stack Dev"
- Task 2-E: "**UX/UI** + Full-Stack Dev"
- Task 2-F: "**UX/UI** + Full-Stack Dev"

**Needed for:**
- Onboarding flow design and refinement
- Cockpit dashboard UI improvements
- Calendar view UX
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)
- Design system consistency (Radix UI + Tailwind)

**Specialization should include:**
- Interface design (Figma/mockups not needed - we work in code)
- User flow optimization
- Accessibility audits (ARIA, keyboard nav, screen readers)
- Mobile-first responsive patterns
- Design system consistency
- Component composition patterns
- Visual hierarchy and information architecture

**Example use cases:**
```
"Review onboarding flow for UX issues - too many steps?"
"Design calendar view interaction patterns"
"Audit accessibility compliance for dashboard"
"Optimize mobile experience for cockpit page"
```

#### 2. Data Integration Engineer
**Why missing:** Garmin sync, file parsing, data transformation are specialized skills

**Sprint mentions:**
- Task 1.5-E: "Garmin Connect API OR GarminDB export pipeline"
- Task 1.5-F: "Wellness data ingestion pipeline"
- Task 1.5-G: "Workout data ingestion pipeline"

**Needed for:**
- GarminDB SQLite ‚Üí Postgres sync
- TCX/GPX/FIT file parsing
- Data normalization and transformation
- Integration with external APIs (Garmin, Strava future)
- ETL pipeline design
- Data quality validation
- Webhook handling (future)

**Specialization should include:**
- File format parsing (TCX, GPX, FIT)
- SQLite ‚Üí Postgres migrations

"Handle duplicate workout detection"
```

**Why Backend Engineer isn't enough:**
Backend Engineer focuses on API routes and business logic. Data Integration Engineer specializes in external data sources, file parsing, and ETL pipelines.
