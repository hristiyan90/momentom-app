## Agent Coordination Log

### Session 1 (Oct 27, 2025)

**Orchestrator (Claude Code):**
- Analyzed project (auth, database, frontend, backend)
- Identified 14 gaps, prioritized into 4 critical + 3 high + 4 medium + 3 low
- Archived Cursor workflow to /docs/archive/cursor/
- Created multi-agent system (CLAUDE.md + workflow docs)
- User selected Option A (fix foundation first)
- Planned 2-week roadmap
- Launched Backend Engineer for GAP-2

**Backend Engineer:**
- Task: Implement session refresh server-side logic
- Status: Launched, awaiting invocation limit reset
- Expected Deliverables:
  - Updated lib/auth/session.ts (refresh token extraction + retry logic)
  - New lib/auth/__tests__/session.test.ts (6 test cases)
  - Verification instructions (cURL examples)

**Next Session Actions:**
1. Complete Backend Engineer task for GAP-2
2. Launch Frontend Engineer for GAP-2
3. Launch QA Engineer for GAP-2
4. Create PR for session management
5. Move to GAP-1 (Onboarding Persistence)

---

## Session Management Specification (GAP-2)

### Current State
- ‚úÖ `refreshSession()` exists in lib/auth/session.ts
- ‚ùå `getSession()` returns empty refresh_token (line 60)
- ‚ùå No retry logic (policy requires 3 attempts)
- ‚ùå No client-side auto-refresh hook

### Requirements (Policy: auth-mapping.md lines 75-83)
- Auto-refresh 5 minutes before JWT expiration
- 3 retry attempts with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s)
- Redirect to /login after 3 failed attempts
- Update cookies after successful refresh

### Implementation Plan

**Backend (lib/auth/session.ts):**
1. Fix `getSession()`: Extract refresh_token from `sb-refresh-token` cookie
2. Update `refreshSession()`: Add retry logic (3 attempts, exponential backoff)
3. Tests: lib/auth/__tests__/session.test.ts (6 test cases)

**Frontend (lib/hooks/useSession.ts - NEW):**
1. Create React hook that monitors session
2. Poll every 30s when expires_at < 5 minutes
3. Call refreshSession() with retry logic
4. Redirect to /login on final failure
5. Return { session, loading, error }

**Integration (app/layout.tsx):**
1. Wrap app in SessionProvider
2. useSession hook monitors globally

**Testing:**
- Unit tests for both server and client
- Integration test: Login ‚Üí wait ‚Üí auto-refresh
- Edge cases: Network failures, invalid token

**Estimated Effort:** 6 hours
- Backend: 2 hours
- Frontend: 3 hours
- QA: 1 hour
