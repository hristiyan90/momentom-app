# Auto-Log Process

This document defines two key processes for maintaining project documentation and tracking.

**See Also:**
- `docs/process/CURSOR_BOOT.md` - Main workflow process with C0-C5 stages
- `docs/process/TASK_FLOW.md` - Master task flow overview
- `docs/process/CURSOR_WORKFLOW.md` - High-level workflow reference
- `docs/decisions/DECISION_LOG.md` - Decision log entries

## Decision Log Process (ADR / RFC)

Run this **after your plan is approved**, before coding starts.

### When to create an RFC
If a task would change **OpenAPI**, **RLS**, **security policy**, or **caching semantics**, first:
1) Create `docs/rfcs/RFC_<slug>.md` (Status: Proposed, Summary, Motivation, Impact, Alternatives).
2) Add a row to `docs/decisions/DECISION_LOG.md` linking the RFC.
3) **Do not** change `/openapi/` or `/docs/policy/` until the RFC is marked **Accepted**.

### When to write an ADR
If you make a notable architectural/process decision that does **not** change contracts/policy:
1) Create `docs/decisions/ADR_<nnnn>_<slug>.md` (Status: Accepted/Rejected/Superseded).
2) Append a row to `docs/decisions/DECISION_LOG.md` with ID, title, date, owner, links.

### If no ADR/RFC is needed
Add a "Decisions" section in the PR description with a one-liner:
> No ADR/RFC needed. No contract/policy/RLS/caching changes.

Commit these records as `docs(decisions): ...` inside the same PR.

## Auto-Log Ritual (Task Tracking)

At the end of each task/PR, paste an "OPS DIGEST" comment into the PR and update STATUS where applicable.

## OPS DIGEST (template)
- Task: <e.g., B2 ‚Äî Manual Workout Upload (TCX/GPX)>
- Branch/PR: <branch> ‚Üí #<PR>
- Status: ‚úÖ Ready for review | ‚è≥ Blocked: <why>
- Contract: <OpenAPI change? yes/no>
- Policies: <e.g., ETag on GET only; POST no-store>
- RLS: <e.g., staging rows scoped by athlete_id (policy added)>
- cURLs (paste the actual runs):
  - <example> POST /api/_internal/ingest/workout ‚Üí 202 (multipart ok, <25MB enforced)
  - <example> GET /api/ingest/status ‚Üí 200 (ETag present)
- CI: OpenAPI diff ‚úÖ Newman ‚úÖ Smoke H1‚ÄìH7 ‚úÖ (attach artifacts if failed)
- Follow-ups: <bullets>

## STATUS updates
For any status banner in README or docs/process/STATUS.md, reflect newly active tasks and sprint progress.

## Historical Entries (Superseded)

### B3: UX Wiring to Live GETs - Original Scope (Superseded)
Status: üìù Draft (re-scoped into B3a/B3b/B3c/B3d)
Original Scope: Wire existing UI components to live GET endpoints, add loading/error/empty states, capture screenshots with real data
Superseded By: B3a (infrastructure), B3b (cockpit), B3c (calendar), B3d (progress), B3e (Garmin integration)
Reason: Scope too large for single task, better managed as separate focused tasks
