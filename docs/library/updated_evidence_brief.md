# Workout Library Evidence Brief

## Rationale

The Momentum Workout Library is designed based on established principles of endurance training, sports science research, and real-world athlete feedback. Each workout is carefully crafted to provide specific training adaptations while maintaining safety and effectiveness.

## Training Principles

### Periodization
- **Base Phase**: Aerobic development, general strength, injury prevention
- **Build Phase**: Threshold work, sport-specific strength, progressive overload
- **Peak Phase**: Race-specific preparation, high-intensity work
- **Taper Phase**: Sharpening without fatigue, neuromuscular activation
- **Recovery Phase**: Active recovery, low-intensity work, mental recovery

### Intensity Zones
- **Z1 (Recovery)**: 50-60% max HR, active recovery, base building
- **Z2 (Aerobic)**: 60-70% max HR, aerobic base, fat oxidation
- **Z3 (Tempo)**: 70-80% max HR, muscular endurance, lactate threshold
- **Z4 (Threshold)**: 80-90% max HR, lactate threshold, sustainable power
- **Z5 (VO2 Max)**: 90-100% max HR, maximum oxygen uptake, power

### Sport-Specific Considerations

#### Running
- **Impact forces**: Gradual progression, surface variety
- **Biomechanics**: Cadence work, form drills
- **Energy systems**: Aerobic base, lactate threshold
- **Injury prevention**: Strength work, mobility

#### Cycling
- **Power output**: Sustainable power, cadence work
- **Position**: Aero position, bike fit
- **Energy systems**: Aerobic base, threshold power
- **Muscular endurance**: Tempo work, long rides

#### Swimming
- **Technique**: Stroke efficiency, breathing patterns
- **CSS pace**: Critical swim speed, threshold work
- **Water feel**: Neuromuscular activation, stroke rate
- **Endurance**: Aerobic base, distance work

#### Strength
- **Movement patterns**: Hinge, squat, push, pull
- **Injury prevention**: Sport-specific weaknesses
- **Power development**: Explosive movements
- **Recovery**: Low volume, high quality

## Triathlon-Specific Design Features

### Half-Distance (70.3) Optimization
The library is optimized for half-distance triathlon training:
- **Long run**: Up to 120 minutes (2 hours)
- **Long bike**: Up to 180 minutes (3 hours)
- **Long swim**: Up to 3000m continuous
- **Brick workouts**: Bike-to-run transition simulation
- **Race simulation**: Peak phase race-distance efforts

### Friel's Training Abilities Integration
All six of Friel's key training abilities are addressed:
1. **Aerobic Endurance (AE)**: 43 Z1-Z2 workouts
2. **Muscular Endurance (ME)**: 14 Z3 tempo workouts
3. **Anaerobic Endurance (AnE)**: 26 Z4 threshold workouts
4. **Speed Skills (SS)**: 8 neuromuscular workouts
5. **Force (F)**: 18 strength workouts + hill repeats
6. **Power (P)**: 10 VO2max workouts

### 80/20 Training Distribution
Library supports Friel's 80/20 rule:
- 80% of training time in Z1-Z2 (aerobic endurance)
- 20% of training time in Z3-Z5 (tempo, threshold, VO2max)

Plan generation algorithm selects workouts to achieve proper distribution.

### Training Stress Balance (TSB)
- **Load hints** proxy for Friel's TSS (Training Stress Score)
