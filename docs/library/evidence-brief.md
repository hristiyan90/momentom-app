# Workout Library Evidence Brief

## Rationale

The Momentom Workout Library is designed based on established principles of endurance training, sports science research, and real-world athlete feedback. Each workout is carefully crafted to provide specific training adaptations while maintaining safety and effectiveness.

## Training Principles

### Periodization
- **Base Phase**: Aerobic development, general strength, injury prevention
- **Build Phase**: Threshold work, sport-specific strength, progressive overload
- **Peak Phase**: Race-specific preparation, high-intensity work
- **Taper Phase**: Sharpening without fatigue, neuromuscular activation
- **Recovery Phase**: Active recovery, low-intensity work, mental recovery

### Intensity Zones
- **Z1 (Recovery)**: 50-60% max HR, active recovery, base building
- **Z2 (Aerobic)**: 60-70% max HR, aerobic base, fat oxidation
- **Z3 (Tempo)**: 70-80% max HR, muscular endurance, lactate threshold
- **Z4 (Threshold)**: 80-90% max HR, lactate threshold, sustainable power
- **Z5 (VO2 Max)**: 90-100% max HR, maximum oxygen uptake, power

### Sport-Specific Considerations

#### Running
- **Impact forces**: Gradual progression, surface variety
- **Biomechanics**: Cadence work, form drills
- **Energy systems**: Aerobic base, lactate threshold
- **Injury prevention**: Strength work, mobility

#### Cycling
- **Power output**: Sustainable power, cadence work
- **Position**: Aero position, bike fit
- **Energy systems**: Aerobic base, threshold power
- **Muscular endurance**: Tempo work, long rides

#### Swimming
- **Technique**: Stroke efficiency, breathing patterns
- **CSS pace**: Critical swim speed, threshold work
- **Water feel**: Neuromuscular activation, stroke rate
- **Endurance**: Aerobic base, distance work

#### Strength
- **Movement patterns**: Hinge, squat, push, pull
- **Injury prevention**: Sport-specific weaknesses
- **Power development**: Explosive movements
- **Recovery**: Low volume, high quality
