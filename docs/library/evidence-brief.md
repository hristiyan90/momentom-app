# Evidence Brief: Workout Library

## Research Foundation

### Exercise Science Principles

The workout library is built upon established exercise science principles and evidence-based training methodologies. Each workout template incorporates validated training protocols that have demonstrated effectiveness in improving fitness outcomes.

### Key Research Areas

#### 1. Cardiovascular Training
- **HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training)**: Proven effective for improving VO2 max and metabolic health
- **Steady-State Cardio**: Essential for building aerobic base and endurance
- **Zone-Based Training**: Heart rate zones provide structured intensity guidance

#### 2. Strength Training
- **Progressive Overload**: Systematic increase in training stimulus over time
- **Movement Patterns**: Focus on fundamental human movement patterns
- **Periodization**: Structured variation in training intensity and volume

#### 3. Flexibility and Mobility
- **Dynamic Stretching**: Effective for warm-up and movement preparation
- **Static Stretching**: Beneficial for cool-down and flexibility maintenance
- **Mobility Work**: Addresses movement limitations and injury prevention

### Evidence Sources
