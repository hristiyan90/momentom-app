# Library Brief

## Overview

The Library is a collection of structured workout templates that can be used to create consistent, repeatable training sessions. Each workout template contains detailed instructions, parameters, and metadata that guide the execution of specific training protocols.

## Purpose

- **Standardization**: Provide consistent workout structures across different training sessions
- **Scalability**: Enable easy addition of new workout types and variations
- **Flexibility**: Support various training modalities and intensity levels
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear records of workout protocols and their intended use

## Structure

### Workout Templates

Each workout template follows a standardized JSON schema that includes:

- **Metadata**: Name, description, category, difficulty level
- **Parameters**: Duration, intensity, equipment requirements
- **Instructions**: Step-by-step execution guidelines
- **Variations**: Alternative approaches or modifications
- **Safety Notes**: Important considerations and contraindications

### File Organization

- `library/workouts.json`: Main collection of workout templates
- `docs/library/template.workout.json`: Schema template for new workouts
- `docs/library/coverage-checklist.md`: Quality assurance guidelines
- `docs/library/evidence-brief.md`: Research and validation documentation

## Usage

1. **Adding New Workouts**: Use the template schema to create new workout definitions
2. **Quality Assurance**: Follow the coverage checklist to ensure completeness
3. **Evidence Review**: Reference the evidence brief for research-backed protocols
4. **Integration**: Workouts integrate with the main application's training system

## Maintenance

- Regular review of workout effectiveness
- Updates based on user feedback and performance data
- Version control for template changes
- Documentation updates to reflect new research or best practices
