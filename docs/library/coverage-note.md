# Workout Library v0 — Coverage Note (Drop-1)

**Scope:** Drop-1 seed (10 items) to validate UI/ingestion and set direction for the full 120–150 library in Drop-2.

## Phase coverage
- **Base (4):** Run Z2 endurance; Bike Z2 endurance + tempo; Strength full-body; (Swim base-technique variants will land in Drop-2).
- **Build (3):** Run threshold 3×10 (Z4); Bike threshold 3×12 (Z4); Swim CSS 10×2 @ Z4.
- **Taper (3):** Run sharpener (strides); Bike opener (short Z4 exposures, reduced volume); Swim sharpener (6×1 fast with plenty easy). Strength includes a taper-safe run-support session.

## Key session distribution by sport
- **Run:** Aerobic endurance (Z2), Threshold (Z4), Neuromuscular strides (taper-safe).
- **Bike:** Aerobic endurance (Z2), Threshold (Z4), Taper opener with controlled intensity.
- **Swim:** CSS/threshold progressions, Taper sharpener with short fast reps.
- **Strength:** General full-body (base), Run-support (taper-safe low DOMS).

## Taper-safe examples (≥1 per sport in Drop-1)
- **Run:** 30′ + 6×1′ strides (keeps neuromuscular feel; low load).
- **Bike:** 50′ with 3×2′ Z4 (maintain intensity signal without fatigue).
- **Swim:** 30′ with 6×1′ fast (short reps, high recovery).
- **Strength:** 30′ run-support (light loads, no eccentric overload).

**Notes for Drop-2:** Add peak-phase race-specific bricks, VO₂ sets, additional taper options (≥3 per sport), and more swim technique/CSS progressions to reach 120–150 total.
