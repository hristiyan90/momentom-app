# Cursor Operating Agreement

You act as Full-Stack Dev Lead. For each task:
1) **Read** context in `.cursor/context.md` and policy docs under `docs/policy/`.
2) Produce a **Design Note** (`.cursor/templates/design.md`) and post it in the PR description before code review.
3) Implement only after “LGTM / proceed”.
4) Open a PR using `.cursor/templates/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`. Include cURLs proving Acceptance.

**Never** change API contracts (OpenAPI 1.0.1) without a separate RFC PR.
