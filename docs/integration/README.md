# Onboarding API Integration - Complete Package

## 📋 Overview

This directory contains everything needed to integrate the Momentom onboarding UI with the GAP-1 persistence APIs. All backend APIs are implemented, QA-approved, and ready for frontend integration.

## 🎯 Goal

Enable users to save their onboarding data (profile, preferences, races, constraints) to the database so that:
- Data persists across sessions
- Users can return to onboarding later
- Training plans can access real athlete data
- Users can skip to dashboard and continue setup later

## 📦 What's Included

### Core Implementation Files

| File | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `/lib/api/onboarding.ts` | API client functions for all 9 endpoints | ✅ Complete |
| `/lib/hooks/useOnboardingPersistence.ts` | React hook encapsulating persistence logic | ✅ Complete |

### Documentation Files

| File | Purpose | Best For |
|------|---------|----------|
| `QUICK-REFERENCE.md` | 1-page cheat sheet | Developers doing integration |
| `IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md` | Complete technical overview | Technical leads, code review |
| `GAP-1-ONBOARDING-INTEGRATION.md` | Detailed integration guide | Developers (first-time read) |

2. **Review examples**: `onboarding-modifications.tsx` (10 minutes)
3. **Apply changes**: Modify onboarding pages (2 hours)
4. **Test**: Run through onboarding flow (30 minutes)

## 📊 What Gets Saved

| User Action | Data Saved | Database Table |
|-------------|------------|----------------|
| Completes profile step | Name, DOB, experience, availability | `athlete_profiles` |
| Adds races | Race date, type, priority, location | `race_calendar` |
| Sets preferences | Training time, metrics, day availability | `athlete_preferences` |
| Adds constraints | Injuries, equipment, availability | `athlete_constraints` |

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Onboarding UI
    ↓ (uses)
useOnboardingPersistence Hook
    ↓ (maps data & handles errors)
API Client Functions
    ↓ (HTTP requests)
Backend API Routes
    ↓ (validates & saves)
Supabase Database
```

**Key benefit**: All complexity isolated in the hook. UI code stays clean.

## 🎨 User Experience

### After Integration
- ✅ Nice UI

- ✅ Can complete over multiple sessions
- ✅ Can skip to dashboard anytime
- ✅ Loading spinners during save
- ✅ Clear error messages
- ✅ Automatic retry capability

## ⏱️ Estimates

| Task | Time | Who |
|------|------|-----|
| Review documentation | 30 min | Developer |
| Implement advanced onboarding | 1.5 hours | Developer |
| Implement quick start | 45 min | Developer |
| Manual testing | 30 min | Developer |
| QA testing | 1 hour | QA Engineer |
| **Total** | **4.5 hours** | **Team** |

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Developer Testing (Before QA)

1. ✅ Complete profile → Verify saves to DB
2. ✅ Add race → Verify saves to DB
3. ✅ Set preferences → Verify saves to DB
4. ✅ Refresh page → Verify data reloads
5. ✅ Logout and try to save → Verify error message
6. ✅ Complete quick start → Verify all data saves

### QA Testing (Before Production)

1. ✅ All developer tests pass
2. ✅ Test error scenarios (network, validation, auth)
3. ✅ Test edge cases (skip steps, refresh mid-flow)
4. ✅ Test on different browsers
5. ✅ Test with slow network
6. ✅ Verify database constraints

## 🎯 Success Metrics

Track after deployment:

- **Completion Rate**: % who finish onboarding
- **Data Quality**: % with valid data in DB
- **Error Rate**: % who encounter errors
- **Time to Complete**: Median completion time
- **Return Rate**: % who complete over multiple sessions

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Email field**: Currently using temp email (`firstname.lastname@temp.local`) until real email capture added to UI
2. **Profile prerequisites**: Preferences/races require profile to exist first (enforced by API)
3. **Race editing**: Quick Start doesn't support editing races after creation (use advanced onboarding for that)

## 🔒 Security Notes

- ✅ All API calls authenticated via session cookie
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) enforced on all tables
- ✅ Athletes can only access their own data
- ✅ No way to access other users' data
- ✅ Session expiration handled gracefully

## 📞 Support

### Questions About...

- **API behavior**: Review `/app/api/athlete/*` and `/app/api/races/*` route files
- **Data mapping**: Review `/lib/hooks/useOnboardingPersistence.ts` mappers
- **Integration steps**: Read `GAP-1-ONBOARDING-INTEGRATION.md`
- **Quick examples**: Read `onboarding-modifications.tsx`
- **Error handling**: Search for `getErrorMessage` in `/lib/api/onboarding.ts`

### Common Questions

**Q: What if the API call fails?**
A: Error message displays to user, they can retry by clicking "Next" again.

**Q: What if user refreshes mid-onboarding?**
A: Saved data reloads automatically via `useEffect` hook.

**Q: Can user skip onboarding?**
A: Yes, "Skip to Dashboard" button appears after profile is saved.

**Q: What data is required vs optional?**
A: Profile is required. Races, preferences, and constraints are optional.

**Q: How do we test without affecting production?**
A: Use different Supabase projects for dev/staging/production.
